## Haskell
Haskell is a computer programming language. In particular, it is a polymorphically statically typed, lazy, purely functional language, quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the lambda calculus, hence the lambda we use as a logo.

## Why use Haskell?
Haskell offers you:

- Substantially increased programmer productivity.
- Shorter, clearer, and more maintainable code.
- Fewer errors, higher reliability.
- A smaller "semantic gap" between the programmer and the language.
- Shorter lead times.
